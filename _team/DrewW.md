Drew is a postdoctoral research and data scientist, focused on exploring ways in which natural language processing and data science methods can be leveraged to improve health, connectedness, and reduce patient stigmatization. His main research interests involve identification of stigmatizing provider language and social isolation in the EHR, suicide harm reduction using large-scale text datasets, and development and evaluation of novel adolescent and young adult palliative care support programs. Drew conducts research in collaboration with faculty in Biomedical Informatics, CDC’s Injury and Prevention Center, and University of Florida’s Streetlight AYA palliative care peer support program. Drew received his PhD in Emory’s Behavioral, Social, and Health Education Sciences Department, his Masters of Science in Health Education and Behavior, and brings years of clinical experience directing hospital-based peer support programming to his research work.
