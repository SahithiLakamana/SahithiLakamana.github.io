Social network analysis is a well-known method for discovering the social complexities of relationships. In this paper, we present the results of its application in a healthcare environment, i.e. a state university hospital. The sociometric method was adopted to collect social network data. The analysis was performed using Pajek. The medical practice/academic and technological networks among physicians of a state university hospital were explored. Monomorphic and polymorphic opinion leaders (OLs) within the networks were identified using the in-degree measure. Cohesiveness were investigated based on network density and average degree. In addition, it was checked if the mentor system may present impact on the formation of social networks among physicians.
