# Background
High-value cancer care balances effective treatment with preservation of quality of life. Chemotherapy is known to affect patients' physical and psychological well-being negatively. Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) provide a means to monitor declines in a patients' well-being during treatment.

# Methods 
We identified 741 oncology patients undergoing chemotherapy in our electronic health record (EHR) system who completed Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) surveys during treatment at a comprehensive cancer center, 2013-2018. PROMIS surveys were collected before, during, and after chemotherapy treatment. Linear mixed-effects models were performed to identify predictors of physical and mental health scores over time. A k-mean cluster analysis was used to group patient PROMIS score trajectories.

# Results
Mean global physical health (GPH) scores were 48.7 (SD 9.3), 47.7 (8.8), and 48.6 (8.9) and global mental health (GMH) scores were 50.4 (8.6), 49.5 (8.8), and 50.6 (9.1) before, during, and after chemotherapy, respectively. Asian race, Hispanic ethnicity, public insurance, anxiety/depression, stage III cancer, and palliative care were predictors of GPH and GMH decline. The treatment time period was also a predictor of both GPH and GMH decline relative to pre-treatment. Trajectory clustering identified four distinct PRO clusters associated with chemotherapy treatment.

# Conclusions
Patient-reported outcomes are increasingly used to help monitor cancer treatment and are now a part of care reimbursement. This study leveraged routinely collected PROMIS surveys linked to EHRs to identify novel patient trajectories of physical and mental well-being in oncology patients undergoing chemotherapy and potential predictors. Supportive care interventions in high-risk populations identified by our study may optimize resource deployment.

# Novelty and impact
This study leveraged routinely collected patient-reported outcome (PROMIS) surveys linked to electronic health records to characterize oncology patients' quality of life during chemotherapy. Important clinical and demographic predictors of declines in quality of life were identified and four novel trajectories to guide personalized interventions and support. This work highlights the utility of monitoring patient-reported outcomes not only before and after, but during chemotherapy to help advert adverse patient outcomes and improve treatment adherence.
