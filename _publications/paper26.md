This study provides insights that could help to improve the Radiological Society of North America (RSNA) Reporting Template Digital Library, based on a usability evaluation. The results show that most users have been satisfied with the website. The general comments for the library are positive, although the participants suggested quite a few areas to improve. About 40% are returning visitors which means people often come back to the website.
