Clinical and pathological stage are defining parameters in oncology, which direct a patientâ€™s treatment options and prognosis. Pathology reports contain a wealth of staging information that is not stored in structured form in most electronic health records (EHRs). Therefore, we evaluated three supervised marchine learning methods (Support Vector Machine, Decision Trees, Gradient Boosting) to classify free-text pathology reports for prostate cancer into T, N and M stage groups.
