# Background
Preoperative goals of care discussion and documentation are important for patients undergoing surgery, a major healthcare stressor that incurs risk. We aim to assess disparities in preoperative goals of care planning and other factors implicated in access.

# Methods
We retrospectively analyzed 250,212 veterans who underwent surgeries between January 1, 2017, and September 28, 2022, at the Veterans Healthcare Administration (VHA). Our primary outcome was preoperative life-sustaining treatment (LST) documentation within 30 days prior to day of surgery. We aimed to assess impact of race (white/Black/other) and ethnicity (Hispanic/non-Hispanic) on preoperative LST completion and use binomial logistic regression, adjusted for patient and surgical characteristics.

# Preliminary results
7,633 (3.8%) patients completed preoperative LST, and 192,560 (96.2%) did not. White (78.5%), male (94.2%), and non-Hispanic (92.9%) patients tended to complete LST before surgery. Patients from urban residences (66.0%) also had preoperative LST documentation more often. In addition, patients with Care Needs Assessment score ≥80 (1.6%), indicating high risk of hospitalization or death, or Charlson Comorbidity Index ≥4 (49.7%), indicating high risk of death, tended to complete preoperative LST.

# Conclusions
A minority of surgical patients completed preoperative LST, with pervasive disparities in documentation rates based on race, ethnicity, and rurality of patient residence within a VHA cohort.

# Implications
As preoperative discussion and documentation of patient preferences is a quality standard, racial and socioeconomic disparities should be addressed for surgical patients.
