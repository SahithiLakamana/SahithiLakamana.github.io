# Objective
Classification systems are used to facilitate reporting and analysis of healthcare data. The International Classification of Diseases and Health Related Problems (ICD) is produced by the World Health Organization and is used globaly. In Turkey use of ICD-10 has been mandatory in government healthcare organisations since July 2005. The aim of this study was to evaluate ICD-10 system implementation in a university hospital from the perspective of end users. 

# Methods
All ICD-10 codes entered into the Akdeniz University Hospital information system from 1 January 2006 to 30 September 2006 were analysed. In addition, a questionnaire consisting of 19 questions related to computer usage and ICD-10 implementation was distributed to 574 clinicians working in 28 departments. 

# Results
A total of 432,220 codes were entered into the system during the nine months of evaluation. The most common codes entered were for general examination (46%). Codes entered for specific diseases were low, e.g. atherosclerotic heart disease (1%). Questionnaires were returned by 289 respondents, the majority of whom were residents (52%). Most respondents believed that it was necessary to use ICD-10 (77%), but 45% thought ICD-10 is limited and more than half (56%) stated they have problems finding appropriate codes for every disease. This difficulty was not related to computer literacy as the vast majority (98%) were computer literate. Almost half (44%) felt that their ICD-10 knowledge was insufficient, and 73% stated that they had not received any training on ICD-10. This was felt to be an important component with 62% expressing a wish to attend a training program. 

# Conclusion
ICD-10 is not being properly or effectively used in the hospital. The main factors contributing to this are lack of training, an absence of useful tools for coding, limitations of the ICD-10 system and some organisational problems. These factors will need to be addressed if the benefits associated with proper ICD-10 coding are to be realised.
